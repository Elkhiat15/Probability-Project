# Employee Turnover Prediction with Early Warning System
## Overview

This is a data science project that focuses on predicting employee turnover using statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict the probability of employees quitting their jobs and acts as **Early Warning System**, allowing the company to take proactive measures to retain valuable talent.

### please check my updates on this project as I deployed it as a [web app](https://retainradar-fafvmavjduenrv58dfnrtk.streamlit.app/), also check the [code](https://github.com/Elkhiat15/RetainRadar)  

## Dataset

The dataset `"Employee_Attrition.csv"` consists of various features related to employees, such as their job satisfaction, overtime, monthly income, age, and more. It also includes a binary target variable indicating whether an employee has quit or not.
the data is obtained from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) you can find it [there](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset).


## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install necessary dependencies and packages.
3. Ensure the `"Employee_Attrition.csv"` dataset is in place.
4. Run the notebooks and injoy with the plots and the interactive dashboard at the end of the notebook.

## Results

The notebook provides detailed steps for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. It also includes visualizations to gain insights into the data and the model's performance.
Finally I enhaced the project with an interactive dash board.
You can use an interactive dashboard that build by [gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) library by choosing employee features like his monthly income, department, satisfaction rate ...etc then you can find the model show you the probability to this employee to quit and his risk level.


## Future Improvements

This project can be further enhanced in the following ways:

- Collecting additional data to improve the model's accuracy and generalization.
- Experimenting with different machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter tuning.
- ~~Building a web application using libraries as [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).~~
- ~~Deploying the model as a web application or API for real-time predictions.~~   
  Already done, check the demo [here](https://retainradar-fafvmavjduenrv58dfnrtk.streamlit.app/).
